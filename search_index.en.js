sort TailwindCSS classes with a few divergences. \nNaively I went for the Regex approach. The algorithm went something like:\n\nFetch all class attributes with a complex Regex\nWithin that, validate and substitute all Elixir code\nSort the variants and classes in layers\nPut back the Elixir functions\nAdd additional ASCII to properly swap it out\n\nHere are the four regex patterns the library uses to find classes:\n@class_pattern ~r/(?:class\\s*(?:=|:)\\s*)((\\{)|('|\"))(.|\\s)*?(?(2)\\}|(\"|'))/i\n@inline_func_pattern ~r/#\\{((?:(?:(?!(#\\{|\\})).)|(?R))*)\\}/i\n@dynamic_classes ~r/[[:alnum:]-]*#\\{([^}]+)\\}*/i\n@invalid_input ~r/[^_a-zA-Z0-9\\$\\s\\-:\\[\\]\\/\\.\\#]+/\n\nPretty complicated…\nSince the class attribute within a Phoenix template can hold any valid Elixir expression, one can conclude this isn’t sustainable. \nThe solution is to use the Phoenix tokenizers and handle the AST representation of each class. \nSo I took the time and converted the library over to use the Phoenix tokenizers. It’s a lot simpler, but I wouldn’t entirely attribute it to the different approach. \nAfter programming in Elixir for awhile, I found some of my previous code easier to clean up.\nHere’s the new entry point of the plugin:\n  def format(contents, _opts) do\n    contents\n    |&gt; HEExTokenizer.tokenize()\n    |&gt; Enum.reduce([], &amp;collect_classes/2)\n    |&gt; Enum.reduce(contents, &amp;sort_classes/2)\n  end\n\ncollect_classes is pretty straightforward:\n  defp collect_classes({:tag, _name, attrs, _meta}, acc) do\n    case Enum.find(attrs, &amp;(elem(&amp;1, 0) == \"class\")) do\n      {\"class\", class, _meta} -&gt; [class | acc]\n      nil -&gt; acc\n    end\n  end\n\nsort_classes goes more into the AST stuff which I won’t go through. What it does is that it handles things like:\n&lt;div class={\"grid-cols-#{@num}-custom bg-red-300\"} /&gt; \n&lt;div class={\"#{if @active, do: \"bg-red-50\", else: \"hidden\"} h-10 w-full leading-5\"} /&gt; \n&lt;div class={\"h-6 \" &lt;&gt; if @active, do: \"font-bold\"} /&gt;\n\nElixir expressions.\nInstead, let’s go to the part where it sorts the class string, something like:\n&lt;div class=\"h-8 w-8 bg-slate-500 md:w-16 md:h-12 lg:flex\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\nHere’s the previous sort function entry point:\ndefp sort([]) do\n  []\nend\n\ndefp sort(class_list) do\n  {variants, base_classes} = separate(class_list)\n  base_sorted = sort_base_classes(base_classes)\n  variant_sorted = sort_variant_classes(variants)\n\n  base_sorted ++ variant_sorted\nend\n\nFor those unfamiliar with Elixir, the above is pattern matching on the function parameter. It goes in declaration order. So in this case, if the parameter passed matches [] it goes to the first function, returning a []. Otherwise it continues to check against the other functions.\nLet’s look at sort_base_classes(base_classes)\ndefp sort_base_classes(base_classes) do\n  base_classes\n  |&gt; Enum.map(fn class -&gt;\n    sort_number = get_sort_position(class)\n    {sort_number, class}\n  end)\n  |&gt; Enum.sort_by(&amp;elem(&amp;1, 0))\n  |&gt; Enum.map(&amp;elem(&amp;1, 1))\nend\n\nThis was poorly written, and was written by me. You can reduce this down to:\nEnum.sort_by(base_classes, &amp;class_position/1)\n\nI’m not sure why I thought I had to explicitly store the position of the class in order to sort it. But it isn’t needed at all.\nAnother example is sort_variant_classes. It’s a large chain of functions, bear with me:\ndefp sort_variant_classes(variants) do\n  variants\n  |&gt; group_by_first_variant()\n  |&gt; sort_variant_groups()\n  |&gt; sort_classes_per_variant()\n  |&gt; grouped_variants_to_list()\nend\n\ndefp group_by_first_variant(variants) do\n  variants\n  |&gt; Enum.map(&amp;String.split(&amp;1, \":\", parts: 2))\n  |&gt; Enum.group_by(&amp;List.first/1, &amp;List.last/1)\nend\n\ndefp sort_variant_groups(variant_groups) do\n  variant_groups\n  |&gt; Enum.map(fn variant_group -&gt;\n    variant = elem(variant_group, 0)\n    sort_number = Map.get(Defaults.variant_order(), variant, -1)\n\n    {sort_number, variant_group}\n  end)\n  |&gt; Enum.sort_by(&amp;elem(&amp;1, 0))\n  |&gt; Enum.map(&amp;elem(&amp;1, 1))\nend\n\ndefp sort_classes_per_variant(grouped_variants) do\n  Enum.map(grouped_variants, fn variant_group -&gt;\n    {variant, classes_and_variants} = variant_group\n    {variant, sort(classes_and_variants)}\n  end)\nend\n\ndefp grouped_variants_to_list(grouped_variants) do\n  Enum.flat_map(grouped_variants, fn variant_group -&gt;\n    {variant, base_classes} = variant_group\n\n    Enum.map(base_classes, fn class -&gt;\n      \"#{variant}:#{class}\"\n    end)\n  end)\nend\n\nLooking at the previous example of sort_base_classes() you may notice the same poorly written pattern in sort_variant_groups(). Let’s scrap that function entirely:\ndefp sort_variant_classes(variants) do\n  variants\n  |&gt; group_by_first_variant()\n  |&gt; Enum.sort_by(fn {variant, _rest} -&gt; variant_position(variant) end)\n  |&gt; sort_classes_per_variant()\n  |&gt; grouped_variants_to_list()\nend\n\nMuch simpler and a whole lot more explicit too. I think you only want to use elem() when you’re dealing with larger tuples. It’s better to pattern match against the tuple, and reads a lot easier.\nNext on the list is sort_classes_per_variant():\ndefp sort_classes_per_variant(grouped_variants) do\n  Enum.map(grouped_variants, fn variant_group -&gt;\n    {variant, classes_and_variants} = variant_group\n    {variant, sort(classes_and_variants)}\n  end)\nend\n\nThis function is pointlessly verbose. Maybe I didn’t know about pattern matching in the anonymous function call yet? Not sure.\nLet’s delete that one too:\ndefp sort_variant_classes(variants) do\n  variants\n  |&gt; group_by_first_variant()\n  |&gt; Enum.sort_by(fn {variant, _rest} -&gt; variant_position(variant) end)\n  |&gt; Enum.map(fn {variant, rest} -&gt; {variant, sort(rest)} end)\n  |&gt; grouped_variants_to_list()\nend\n\nAnd finally, grouped_variants_to_list(). Let’s look at it once more:\ndefp grouped_variants_to_list(grouped_variants) do\n  Enum.flat_map(grouped_variants, fn variant_group -&gt;\n    {variant, base_classes} = variant_group\n\n    Enum.map(base_classes, fn class -&gt;\n      \"#{variant}:#{class}\"\n    end)\n  end)\nend\n\nThis one is okay. It’s verbose and unnecessarily pattern matches within the function call, but it isn’t too horrible compared to the others. We can use the same logic, just reduce it down a bit more.\nHere’s the final implementation of sort_variant_classes():\ndefp sort_variant_classes(variants) do\n  variants\n  |&gt; group_by_first_variant()\n  |&gt; Enum.sort_by(fn {variant, _rest} -&gt; variant_position(variant) end)\n  |&gt; Enum.map(fn {variant, rest} -&gt; {variant, sort(rest)} end)\n  |&gt; Enum.flat_map(fn {variant, rest} -&gt; Enum.map(rest, &amp;\"#{variant}:#{&amp;1}\") end)\nend\n\nWe deleted roughly ~25 lines of code by taking advantage of function pattern matching.\nHere’s how the regular sort function looks now:\ndefp sort(class_list) when is_list(class_list) do\n  {variants, base_classes} = Enum.split_with(class_list, &amp;variant?/1)\n\n  Enum.sort_by(base_classes, &amp;class_position/1) ++ sort_variant_classes(variants)\nend\n\nSome may argue that the temporary variable names added clarity, and I’m not entirely sure. \nI like the less noise in this version, but maybe as I program more I will find myself thinking otherwise.\nIn conclusion, the old approach was messy regex and substitutions. The new version still has substitutions, but this time it’s on the AST. The new algorithm:\n\nParse the tree using Phoenix tokenizer\nGrab all class attributes\nFor class attributes that are strings, pass to sort()\nFor class attributes that are expressions, transform to AST and handle each expression type.\nRender the new sorted string, and substitute it back into the contents.\n\nExpression types can be concatenations (&lt;&gt;) or interpolations (#{@active}). Arrays too (which I’ve yet to add support for, but it’s coming up now that there’s an AST to work with).\nSome of the expression class code is a little complicated. \nI imagine in time there can be another blog post like this that points out inefficiencies.\nBesides support for arrays, I also want to support the tailwind.config.js file of the project. Not sure yet how to execute the JS code that extracts the classes from it. Will see.\nMaintenance work can sometimes be grueling, but also satisfying too.\n","id":"https://100phlecs.github.io/blog/cleaning-up-old-code/","title":"Cleaning up old Elixir code"},"https://100phlecs.github.io/blog/custom-macos-keys/":{"body":"With a bit of research you won’t be surprised to find the QWERTY layout is inefficient. A knee-jerk reaction would be to learn an alternative layout, which I did to some extent. But then one will inevitably discover all of the other inefficiencies attached to keyboard design. And the exhaustion found in “catching up” toward nowhere.\nI bought new keyboards, optimized my layouts further, introduced different “layers” the same way the Shift key is a layer for capitals. Though in the name of preventing hand injury, how the time adds up toward little profit. Here I was diligently practicing a skill I technically already had, just under new terms, for the marginal gain of typing either quicker or less strenuously. I’ve since given up (almost) entirely on the ordeal. Here is my Atreus keyboard which is collecting dust.\n\n  \n  I wiped off the dust for this photo. You can see some residual between the keys.\n\nOne could critique the way in which I approached it all–I completely agree. I fell into the trap anyone does when they begin to question The Defaults: the endless alternatives and the quest to find the perfect one. It’s overwhelming. One may find some similarity in the equally nauseating quest of finding the “perfect” stack. \nIf you enjoy such quests, then you have much to look forward to with computers and keyboards. But if you’re in the no-fun zone like me, or a no-fun zoner in denial (there are many), such quests only serve to frustrate and distract from more interesting stuff. Like actually writing posts or software.\nSo as a no-fun zoner what have I settled on for my keyboard “experience”? If you are a professional pixel-pusher there’s still an underlying incentive to do something about the defaults, unless you enjoy RSI. \nWell, I stick with QWERTY and basic QWERTY keyboards, for one. And finally, I use Karabiner Elements for some quality of life modifications. More specifically, I use goku. To this day I do not know how to write native configs for Karabiner, and I hope I never have to.\nThere are only two essential modifications I use which I would recommend to anyone that uses Emacs keybindings. \n\nMap Right Command to Control\nMap Caps Lock to Hyper1\n\nThe first modification makes it easy to use Emacs shortcuts as it’s now a thumb press. The second modification allows me to use a layer to access hard-to-reach symbols by mapping them on letter-keys, thereby reducing strain.\nFinally, and most importantly, I repurpose both Caps Lock and Right Command depending on the type of key press. If the keys are held, you have the above mappings.\nIf they are tapped, however:\n\nRight Command -&gt; _\nCaps Lock -&gt; Esc\n\nI often program in Snake case languages. Pressing shift and reaching for _ gets old and causes strain. Having easy access to underscore with a thumb press feels natural, like pressing the space bar, and has made programming far easier on me.\n\n  \n  My current keyboard. Chosen because it just works and is small.\n\nA caveat to these dual-mappings is accidental mix-ups between the underscore and the control. When I write too quickly, my intended underscore may register as a Control instead, and therefore trigger an Emacs command (i.e. ctrl+a). \nSometimes there are inefficiencies that you will accept because the alternatives are too complex to bother with and/or setup. This is precisely why I quit using Emacs. As well as NeoVim. I’ve forever cemented myself as a plebeian to the Config Confederation and may no longer participate in the round table of plugins. \nAs a trade off, I only have a few conceptual dotfiles to take along with me. \nEmacs keybindings, some key mappings, and that’s it. \nShouldn’t take too much to configure a new computer from scratch.\nIt’s a central question really: is customization worth the time?\nMy answer: in small doses.\nYou have my answer, and you are entirely welcome to yours. \n1\nHyper is a combination of modifier keys on MacOS. My Hyper is defined as Option, Command, and Shift pressed at the same time. The official Hyper definition includes the Control key too. I forgot why I removed Control from the definition. Vaguely recall that it was due to some conflict with native MacOS keybindings.\n\n","id":"https://100phlecs.github.io/blog/custom-macos-keys/","title":"How I deal with QWERTY"},"https://100phlecs.github.io/journal/":{"body":"2023-09-26\nTech-fatigue is a blessing in a way. \n","id":"https://100phlecs.github.io/journal/","title":"Personal journal"}},"docInfo":{"https://100phlecs.github.io/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://100phlecs.github.io/blog/":{"body":0,"title":2},"https://100phlecs.github.io/blog/cleaning-up-old-code/":{"body":716,"title":5},"https://100phlecs.github.io/blog/custom-macos-keys/":{"body":397,"title":2},"https://100phlecs.github.io/journal/":{"body":7,"title":2}},"length":5},"lang":"English"};
